# Exit Pois

**Exit Pois** is a 2D puzzle-strategy game developed in Unity, inspired by the popular "Exit Pois" game from TikTok. The player must navigate through a procedurally generated grid of cells, from the "START" point to the "EXIT," avoiding obstacles and visiting all open cells before reaching the exit. The game features intuitive mouse-based controls, procedurally generated levels, and a hint system to guide players through more challenging puzzles.

## How to Play

- **Objective**: Navigate from the "START" cell to the "EXIT" cell, visiting all open cells ("O") and avoiding obstacles ("X").
- **Controls**: Move the player by clicking and holding the mouse. Release the mouse to end movement. If the player releases the mouse or hits an obstacle before completing the level, the level resets.

## Features

1. **Procedurally Generated Grid**:
   - Each level is generated dynamically by an algorithm that ensures every level is solvable. The algorithm not only creates the grid but also computes the optimal solution, which can be revealed to the player if needed.
   
2. **Hints System**:
   - Players can activate hints during difficult levels by pressing a button. The correct path from the "START" to the "EXIT" will be displayed, guiding the player through the grid using the solution generated by the algorithm.

3. **Custom Visual Effects**:
   - Each cell is visually represented using a custom shader that creates dynamic circular borders around cells. These borders change color and size to indicate player movement and other gameplay events.

4. **Player Movement**:
   - The player moves by dragging the mouse across adjacent open cells. If movement is interrupted or the player hits an obstacle, the level resets.

5. **Progressive Difficulty**:
   - As players advance, the grid size increases, and the placement of obstacles becomes more complex, providing greater challenges in later levels.

6. **Responsive Visual Feedback**:
   - Cells provide immediate visual feedback, using a custom shader for smooth transitions as the player interacts with the grid.

## Technologies and Concepts Used

1. **Unity Engine (2021.3 or higher)**:
   - The game is built using Unityâ€™s 2D framework, with procedural generation and custom shaders for visual feedback.

2. **Custom Shaders**:
   - The game's visual style relies on a custom shader to render dynamic circular borders around each grid cell. This shader controls the color, thickness, and size of the borders to provide clear visual feedback.

3. **Procedural Level Generation with Solution**:
   - The levels are generated using an algorithm that ensures each level has a valid, solvable path. The solution is also generated and can be revealed through the hint system.

4. **WebGL Deployment on Vercel**:
   - The game is deployed as a WebGL build for online play.

## Future Improvements

- **New Cell Types and Obstacles**: Plan to introduce more variety in the types of cells and obstacles for added gameplay complexity.
- **Enhanced Visual Effects**: Expand the use of shaders to create more dynamic and responsive visual feedback during gameplay.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Further optimize the game for mobile devices, improving performance and introducing touch controls.
